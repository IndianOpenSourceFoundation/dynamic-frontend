# dynamic-frontend

This repository contain the frontend website of dynamic-cli.

We are planning to make our website for our latest product called [dynamic-cli](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli) . Some example websites - [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) , [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). We have to make it simple, clean and single page website.

Suggestions are welcome :)

Tech stack could be any frontend framework - Probably reactjs
